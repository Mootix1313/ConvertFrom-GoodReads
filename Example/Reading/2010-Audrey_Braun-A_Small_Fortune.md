description: When Celia's husband surprises her with a family vacation to Mexico, she expects some downtime to repair their relationship, and her relationship with her teenage-son. A chance encounter sparks memories of a former affair, and Celia is lured from the beach and abducted. At first she thinks she's a random victim; when she discovers someone she trusts betrayed her, she'll stop at nothing to find her way home.
