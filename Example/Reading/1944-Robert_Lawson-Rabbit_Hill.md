description: It has been a while since Folks lived in the Big House, and an even longer time has passed since there has been a garden at the House. All the animals of the Hill are very excited about the new Folks moving in, and they wonder how things are going to change. It???s only a matter of time before the animals of the Hill find out just who is moving in, and they may be a little bit surprised when they do.
