description: After the loss of her husband and two children to a drunk driver, twenty nine year old widow Eva Hernandez sales her home and business. Then to only add salt to her wounds she attacks the drunk driver, lashing out in court, mourning her loss she is given the choice or jail or therapy. With her grief pulling her into the darkness and her anger surrounding her constantly, Eva begins to wonder if these court ordered therapy sessions will ever help her regain who she once was. Michael Williams, a professional licensed therapist has been assigned Eva's case and instantly he sees more to her than the anger and grief that has consumed her soul. Soon he finds himself showing interest and Eva begins to open up. Never to have been one to break the rules, Michael suddenly finds himself getting involved and attracted to the foul mouthed Eva, who he believes that she just could be the girl worth throwing the rules away for. Determined to show Eva that she is allowed to have a happy life and love again, Michael will do everything he can to help her through her pain, adjust moving forward, and pull her from the darkness that has embraced her for so long.
