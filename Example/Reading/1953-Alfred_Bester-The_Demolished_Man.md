description: "ï»¿#4 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series, a library of the finest science fiction ever written. The first Hugo Award winner for best novel in 1953. ???One of the all-time classics of science fiction.??????Isaac Asimov ???Bester's two superb books have stood the test of time. For nearly sixty years they???ve held their place on everybody???s list of the ten greatest sf novels??? ???Robert Silverberg In a world policed by telepaths, Ben Reich plans to commit a crime that hasn???t been heard of in 70 years: murder. That???s the only option left for Reich, whose company is losing a 10-year death struggle with rival D???Courtney Enterprises. Terrorized in his dreams by The Man With No Face and driven to the edge after D???Courtney refuses a merger offer, Reich murders his rival and bribes a high-ranking telepath to help him cover his tracks. But while police prefect Lincoln Powell knows Reich is guilty, his telepath's knowledge is a far cry from admissible evidence. Alfred Bester was among the first important authors of contemporary science fiction. His passionate novels of worldly adventure, high intellect, and tremendous verve, The Stars My Destination and the Hugo Award winning The Demolished Man, established Bester as a s.f. grandmaster, a reputation that was ratified by the Science Fiction Writers of America shortly before his death. Bester also was an acclaimed journalist for Holiday magazine, a reviewer for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and even a writer for Superman."
