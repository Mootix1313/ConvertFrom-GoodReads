description: The New York Times best seller is now a major motion picture starring Lily James and Sam Riley, with Matt Smith, Charles Dance, and Lena Headey. Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is an audacious retelling of English literature???s most enduring novel. This expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem begins when a mysterious plague falls upon the quiet English village of Meryton???and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she???s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers???and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield. It???s the perfect read for literature lovers, zombie fans, and anyone who loves a reanimated Austen.
