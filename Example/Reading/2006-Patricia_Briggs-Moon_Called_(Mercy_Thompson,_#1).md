description: 'THE FIRST MERCY THOMPSON NOVEL! Moon Called is the novel that introduced Patricia Briggs???s Mercy Thompson to the world and launched a #1 bestselling phenomenon... Mercy Thompson is a shapeshifter, and while she was raised by werewolves, she can never be one of them, especially after the pack ran her off for having a forbidden love affair. So she???s turned her talent for fixing cars into a business and now runs a one-woman mechanic shop in the Tri-Cities area of Washington State. But Mercy???s two worlds are colliding. A half-starved teenage boy arrives at her shop looking for work, only to reveal that he???s a newly changed werewolf???on the run and desperately trying to control his animal instincts. Mercy asks her neighbor Adam Hauptman, the Alpha of the local werewolf pack, for assistance. But Mercy???s act of kindness has unexpected consequences that leave her no choice but to seek help from those she once considered family???the werewolves who abandoned her... ???In the increasingly crowded field of kick-ass supernatural heroines, Mercy stands out as one of the best.??????Locus'
