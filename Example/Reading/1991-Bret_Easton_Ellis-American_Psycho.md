description: INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER ??? In this modern classic, the acclaimed New York Times bestselling author explores the incomprehensible depths of madness and captures the insanity of violence in our time or any other. Patrick Bateman moves among the young and trendy in 1980s Manhattan. Young, handsome, and well educated, Bateman earns his fortune on Wall Street by day while spending his nights in ways we cannot begin to fathom. Expressing his true self through torture and murder, Bateman prefigures an apocalyptic horror that no society could bear to confront. ???A masterful satire and a ferocious, hilarious, ambitious, inspiring piece of writing.... An important book.??? ???Katherine Dunn, bestselling author of Geek Love Look for Bret Easton Ellis???s new novel, The Shards, coming in January.
