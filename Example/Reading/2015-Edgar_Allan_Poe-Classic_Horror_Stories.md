Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Guy de Maupassant, William Hope Hodgson, Ambrose Bierce, Edith Wharton, and more. Its selections include some of the finest weird tales ever published, among them Lovecraft's \"The Colour out of Space,\" Blackwood's \"The Willows,\" Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" Bierce's \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" Robert Louis Stevenson's \"The Body-Snatcher,\" William Fryer Harvey's \"August Heat,\" and W.W.
