If you came across this book I am sure you know the incredible impact Python Programming has these days. Python is a simplistic language, however, without something to guide you through the fundamental concepts of programming, you can easily learn everything the wrong way and someday anger all of your programmer friends. With the help of this Python Programming, you will take the very first step in exploring programming in general, as well as the capabilities of Python. In this book you will learn all the core concepts, one step at a time and this is the same approach you should take when practicing. You will learn new operations you can perform on the various data types and data structures, and then work to get used to relying more and more on object-oriented programming techniques. Use this knowledge to pursue machine learning projects, create robots, or build the next big web application that will take over the world. More specifically this guide will take you through: Specific Python Basic Syntax Rules, Variables and Values The Theory of Computer Programming Working With Your Objects And Classes Inside Of Python How to Use Your Python Skills Working with the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm Making a Basic Python Game: Hangman Machine Learning Models Tips For Success Practical exercises to text your skills...and MUCH MORE!! Even if you aren't an expert, you don't need any kind of special talent to become a programmer, or even a data scientist. All you need to do is understand the theory and then put it in application. If you can't grasp it at first, break it down and study it line by line. Squeeze the knowledge out of Python and apply it in the real world!
