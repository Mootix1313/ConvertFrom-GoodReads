description: BINGO is a recreational hobby that will never go out of style. ItA[a??a[s a game adults just love to hate! But it keeps us going back for more. What is supposed to be a pastime of pleasure can grow into pathetic paranoia. Confessions of a Reformed Bingo Addict is a true story based on thirty-something years of laughable memories and annoying experiences with bingo and bingo-buddiesA[a??afrom lying about my age to enter a bingo hall to the grueling task of bringing the husband to a high stakes bingo for the first time. If you are a person who loves golfing, fishing, or any kind of diversion in todayA[a??a[s society, the compulsions are there and are probably very familiar in this book. As bingo players, we really donA[a??a[t take offense too much; weA[a??a[ve seen it, done it, and said it allA[a??aand we want to do it again!
