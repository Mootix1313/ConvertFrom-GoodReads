description: "#1 New York Times bestselling author Patricia Briggs invites readers to follow her into the seductive realm of the Alpha and Omega series??? Anne Latham didn't know how complicated life could be until she became a werewolf and was mated to Charles Cornick, the son???and enforcer???of the leader of the North American werewolves. She didn't know how dangerous it could be either... Anna and Charles have just been enlisted to attend a summit to present Bran's controversial proposition: that the wolves should finally reveal themselves to humans. But the most feared Alpha in Europe is dead set against the plan???and it seems like someone else might be, too. When Anna is attacked by vampires using pack magic, the kind of power only werewolves should be able to draw on, Charles and Anna must combine their talents to hunt down whoever is behind it all???or risk losing everything..."
